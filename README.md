# Java-HTTP-Server

This is a very simply Java HTTP server, mainly created to host media files for streaming programs, but can host
web pages. The code is a bit messy at the moment, my apologies. I believe I was messing around with it a few months ago.
I'll get around to cleaining it up at some point.
